## Overview of the statistical analysis

### Purpose
Using Python, I extracted the temperature measurements in both June and December. Followed by creating a list and making a DataFrame from the list. Finally, generating a summary statistics for both months.

## Results
-June has 1700 points of data. The average temperature shows to be about 75 F. With the minimum being 64 and the max temperature being 85.

-December has over 1517 points of data. The average temperature shows to be about 71 F. With the minimum being 56 and the max temperature being 83.

## Summary
Looking over the data, we get very expected results. Hawaii, being close to the equator has very stable temperatures and would stay for temperate year round. As December rolls around, the temperature drops but only just slightly as the average stays relevantly the same. Now using this code you can adapt it to extract temperature points for any point of the month easily. By switching out 'tobs' with 'prcp' we can even monitor to amount of precipitation by month.
